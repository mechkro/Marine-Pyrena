# Marine-Pyrena
A Pygame powered attempt to create a similar game-play to the SC2 favorite Marine Arena. Will be a 2D topview, continual spawn shooter.

Stages of Development:
  - Define scope of all neccesary components/files required to re-create original
  - Implement the base layers/grid layout, positioning of toplayer
  - Sprite and enviroment interaction
  - Refine sprite movement and responsivness of key inputs
  - Initial performance testing - How many "teams" of how many "Marines" can be loaded
  - Re-design outline of mapping if required
  - The rest of the scope is too far out to be defined at this moment.
